In this tutorial, we will learn how to dynamically create forms from JSON data using the Ant Design of React library. Dynamic rendering of components can be a very useful technique, allowing us to easily control and display different types of forms by editing the JSON. We'll keep it simple, but please refer to their [documentation](https://ant.design/components/overview/) if you want to learn more about their powerful `Form` component.

Here's an example of a JSON object that we'll use. It contains all the fields necessary for one element of the form:

```json
{
  "type": "input",
  "label": "First Name",
  "required": true
}
```

We'll handle the dynamic form element in a separate `FormField` component. To be able to dynamically render a component, we need an object that will map all the components we want to display.

```javascript
import { Input, Form, Checkbox } from "antd";

// mapping of our components
const componentMapping = {
  input: Input,
  password: Input.Password,
  checkbox: Checkbox,
};

function FormElement({ type, label, required, name }) {
  // dynamically select a component from componentMapping object
  const Component = componentMapping[type];
  return (
    <Form.Item
      label={label}
      name={name}
      rules={[{ required, message: "Field is required!" }]}
    >
      <Component />
    </Form.Item>
  );
}
```

Our `FormElement` component receives a couple of props, but the `type` is the important one. It's basically a string that determines what component will be used from the `componentMapping` object. In our example, we mapped only three components, but you can add as many as you like. The other props can also be expanded; a custom error message or the whole rules object can be a prop. In the end, our `App.js` will look something like this:

```javascript
import React from "react";
import { Form } from "antd";
import FormElement from "./FormElement";

function App() {
  const formElements = [
    {
      type: "input",
      label: "First Name",
      required: true,
      name: "firstName",
    },
    {
      type: "input",
      label: "Last Name",
      required: true,
      name: "lastName",
    },
    {
      type: "input",
      label: "Email",
      required: true,
      name: "email",
    },
    {
      type: "password",
      label: "Password",
      required: true,
      name: "password",
    },
    {
      type: "checkbox",
      label: "Stay signed in",
      required: false,
      name: "staySignedIn",
    },
  ];

  return (
    <Form>
      {formElements.map((element, index) => (
        <FormElement key={index} {...element} />
      ))}
    </Form>
  );
}

export default App;
```

Now you can control the form by editing the JSON. Of course, you'll expand your component mapper whenever you add a new form element. This approach offers a flexible and efficient way to handle forms in your React applications.
