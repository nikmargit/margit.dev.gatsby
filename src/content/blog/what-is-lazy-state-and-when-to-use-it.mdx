In React, the `useState` hook accepts a parameter called initial state, which initializes the state on the initial render and is ignored on subsequent re-renders. While this approach is suitable for primitive values, it can be inefficient for state initialization involving expensive computations, such as fetching data or performing complex calculations.

### The Problem

Let's consider the following example:

```javascript
const initialResult = expensiveComputation();

const [result, setResult] = useState(initialResult);
```

Although `expensiveComputation` is called only on the initial render, it will be executed again on every re-render of the component, even though its value remains constant.

### The Solution: Lazy State

To optimize the performance and avoid unnecessary recomputations, we can use lazy initialization, also known as lazy state. Instead of directly providing the initial state value, we pass a function that returns the initial state.

```javascript
const getInitialResult = () => expensiveComputation();

const [result, setResult] = useState(() => getInitialResult());
```

Alternatively, since `expensiveComputation` is already a function, we can pass the function reference directly:

```javascript
const [result, setResult] = useState(expensiveComputation);
```

### When to Use Lazy State

Lazy state is particularly useful when dealing with:

- Computationally expensive initializations.
- Fetching data from APIs or local storage.
- Calculations based on props or context that remain constant throughout component lifecycles.

While lazy state might not be needed in every scenario, it serves as a valuable performance optimization tool, especially in cases where expensive computations are involved.
