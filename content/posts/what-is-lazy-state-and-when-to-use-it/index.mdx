React `useState` hook accepts a parameter called initial state. It's basically the value that initializes our state on the initial render and is ignored on all subsequent re-renders. Sometimes it is a primitive value like number or boolean, but sometimes it is a result of some expensive computation, maybe getting an item from local storage.

```javascript
const initialResult = expensiveComputation()

const [result, setResult] = useState(initialResult)
```
On the face of it, it may look like there is nothing wrong with this code. After all, `expensiveComputation` function will be called only on the initial render, right? Well, not exactly. Because our function component body runs on every re-render of our component, `expensiveComputation` will also run on every re-render, even though its value is not needed anymore.
The solution to this problem is quite simple. Instead of just providing a value, we can pass a function that returns the initial state.

```javascript
const getInitialResult = () => expensiveComputation()

const [result, setResult] = useState(() => getInitialResult())
```

In our example, since the `expensiveComputation` is already a function, we could just pass a function reference, instead of calling the function itself.

```javascript
const [result, setResult] = useState(expensiveComputation)
```

This way we are making sure that React will only call the function on the initial render. This is called the lazy initialization or lazy state, and it's basically a performance optimization. Will you use it often? Probably not, but it can be a pretty useful tool to have.
