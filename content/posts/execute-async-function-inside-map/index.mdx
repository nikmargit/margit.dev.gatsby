title: Execute an async function inside of a map method

excerpt: The JavaScript map method is synchronous, but we will explore the way to make it work with asynchronous functions as well.

> The [`map()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/map) method **creates a new array** populated with the results of calling a provided function on every element in the calling array.

`map()` is a **synchronous** higher-order function that takes a new function and applies it to every element of a given array. What will happen if we provide `map()` with an asynchronous function? Let's take a look:

```javascript
const values = ["Hello", undefined, 42]

async function getValueType(value) {
  return typeof value
}

const types = values.map(getValueType)

console.log(types)
// [Promise, Promise, Promise]
```

`getValuetype` is a simple function that returns the type of the value. We put `async` before it to make sure it will always return a [promise](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise). In the end, we got an array of promises, no surprise there.

We may be inclined to re-write our map to look like this:

```javascript
const types = values.map(async (value) => {
  const type = await getValueType(value)
  return type
})

console.log(types)
// [Promise, Promise, Promise]
```

We will end up with the same array of [promises](https://web.dev/promises/). `map` does not await even if the function provided is `async`. `map()` starts off each promise in order; however, since they're run in parallel, each promise will resolve/reject as they see fit and will likely not settle (fulfill or reject) in order.

To run all the promises in parallel, we will use the `Promise.all().`

> The **`Promise.all()`** method takes an iterable of promises as an input, and returns a single `Promise` that resolves to an array of the results of the input promises.

With all that, we can finally write a solution that can work with an asynchronous function.

```javascript
const values = ["Hello", undefined, 42]

async function getValueType(value) {
  return typeof value
}

const types = values.map(getValueType)

Promise.all(types).then((resolvedTypes) => console.log(resolvedTypes))
```
