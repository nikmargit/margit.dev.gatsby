[Mithril.js](https://mithril.js.org/) is a client-side JavaScript framework for building single page applications. It's extremely small, only 9.5kb gzip, but despite that, it comes with built-in modules for routing and XHR.

The Mithril project provides great [documentation](https://mithril.js.org/#getting-started). You should make sure to check it out. You'll probably notice that there is no mention of a starter template to rapidly start a project. It recommends starting by importing Mithril.js from CDN. While that's an OK solution for working through a tutorial, it's not something we need to launch a new full-fledged project with Mithril.js.

If you ever used React, then you probably heard of [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), a great tool that enables us to create React apps with no build configuration. Luckily, there is a similar tool for Mithril, called [create-mithril-app](https://github.com/highmountaintea/create-mithril-app), and like CRA, it is easy to use.

I will assume that you have newer versions of Node.js and npm installed on your machine.

```bash
npx create-mithril-app my-new-app
cd my-new-app
npm i
npm run dev
```

_Note: I'm using `npx` command to ensure I'm getting the latest version of create-mithril-app and to avoid installing the tool globally. If you want to learn more about npx, check out this great [article](https://medium.com/@maybekatz/introducing-npx-an-npm-package-runner-55f7d4bd282b) by Kat March√°n._

This will create a new project in my-new-app folder, install all the necessary dependencies, and start webpack-dev-server. If you open the browser to [http://localhost:8020](http://localhost:8020/), you should see a `Hello World` screen.

Great, you have a new Mithril.js project set up, now go build something great!
